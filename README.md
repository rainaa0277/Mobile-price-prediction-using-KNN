# Mobile-price-prediction-using-KNN
There is a new mobile company and the CEO wants to give tough fight to big companies like Apple,Samsung etc.  He has no idea of how to estimate price of mobiles his company creates. A simple assumption of the prices will not be profitable in this competitive world. To solve this problem he collects sales data of mobile phones of various companies.  Thus, the CEO has hired you to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone(eg:- RAM,Internal Memory etc) and its selling price. You have to predict a price range indicating how high the price is.
